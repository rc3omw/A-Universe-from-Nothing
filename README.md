This game simulates the creation of God and the Universe from absolute nothingness. All other theories of the creation of the universe start with the laws of physics, mass, energy, space and time already existing. This theory is the only theory that starts from absolutely nothing. The process is quite simple, a positive and negative pair of equal energy photons which cancel to zero can emerge from nothingness because their value is zero. Therefore something can emerge from nothingness, because its value is zero.
